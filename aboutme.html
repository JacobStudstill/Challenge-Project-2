                    This page will provide information on who I am and how to contact me. This portfolio will constantly
                    be changing so
                    feel free to check in
                    every couple of weeks to see new additions to the page.

                    <br><br> My background is in Information technology. I am currently enrolled in the University of
                    Central Florida Computer Science program where I expect to get my Bachelor's of Science in the Fall
                    of 2025. In the year of 2023 I completed the UCF coding bootcamp and recieved my certificate of
                    completion. At this point I am fully equipped for front and
                    back end development. This means I am proficient but not limited to
                    : HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, MySQL, Bootstrap, MongroDB, Express.js.
                    <br><br>

                    I currently reside in Winter Park, FL. Following my Bachelor degree for Computer Science, I will be
                    seeking out
                    work in the Greater Orlando area. I will be searching for software engineer,
                    full-stack, front-end, and back-end developement jobs. Check out the contact tabs at the bottom of
                    the page to see more of the projects I am working on and
                    reach out if you have any questions.
                    <br><br>

                    I have worked as a systems analyst, enterprise technical support, and as a help desk technician. I
                    have experience in customer as well from working at Publix for 3 years. I comfortably can say that
                    not only have I learned how to work well with others, but I have gained not just software experience
                    through school but also hardware experience through past jobs.
